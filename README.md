## Disney Movies and Box Office Success
Explore Disney movie data, then build a linear regression model to predict box office success.

### Project Description
Since the 1930s, Walt Disney Studios has released more than 600 films covering a wide range of genres. While some movies are indeed directed towards kids, many are intended for a broad audience. In this project, the data will be analyzed to see how Disney movies have changed in popularity since its first movie release. Also, performing hypothesis testing to see what aspects of a movie contribute to its success.

This project involves the manipulation of data using pandas, data visualization using Seaborn, making statistical inference and performing two-sample bootstrap hypothesis tests for difference of means.

The dataset used in this project is a modified version of the Disney Character Success dataset from [https://data.world/kgarrett/disney-character-success-00-16](Kelly Garrett).
